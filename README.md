# 👋 

I’m a technical support & QA specialist who fell in love with engineering and never quite recovered.

For the last few years I’ve been deep in the crypto world (Bybit, OKX), handling L2/L3 trading & blockchain issues, auditing complex tickets, and building training so other people don’t have to suffer through the same bugs twice. Somewhere along the way I realised my favourite tickets were the ones that needed DevTools, logs, and a bit of code.

---

## 🛠 What I do

- Debug production issues across **APIs, logs, and UIs**
- Turn noisy support patterns into **clean processes & docs**
- Automate boring manual work with **Python scripts** and small tools
- Build and instrument web apps with **TypeScript / JavaScript**

I’m currently studying **Systems Analysis & Development** and working in **LD/QA** as an SME, but I’m happiest when I’m close to the code and the problem.

## 🔧 Tech I like

- **Languages:** Python, TypeScript, JavaScript  
- **Web:** React/Next-ish frontends, HTML/CSS, browser DevTools  
- **Data & debugging:** HTTP/REST, JSON, logs, SQL basics  
- **Analytics & product:** Playing a lot with **PostHog** – events, feature flags, session replay

---

## 🧪 Things I’ve built (or broken on purpose)

- A small **flight-search scanner** to hunt down cheap tickets  
- Internal tooling to **automate crypto deposit QA checks**  
- Tiny apps & websites to learn stacks by doing, not just reading  

---

## 🌍 A bit more human

I’ve lived in a few countries (including 7 years in Brazil), finished a demanding **Psychology** degree, and still chose to spend my free time building tools and learning to code.

If you’re into debugging weird behaviour, analytics, or “support as engineering”, we’ll probably get along. 🙂
