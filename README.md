## 🧪 Things I’ve built (or broken on purpose)

- **Macedonian Vibe News**  
  The first Macedonian AI-curated news aggregator, built with modern web tooling and deployed on Vercel.

- **JobOps – GenAI Job Assistant**  
  An automatic job search & application helper that parses job ads, structures them and helps tailor applications.

## 🌍 A bit more human

I’ve lived in a few countries (including 7 years in Brazil), finished a demanding **Psychology** degree, and still chose to spend my free time building tools and learning to code.
